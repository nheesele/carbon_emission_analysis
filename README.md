This report aims to analyze carbon emissions to examine the carbon footprint across various industries, identify sectors with the highest levels of emissions by analyzing them across countries and years, as well as to uncover trends.

Through this analysis, we hope to gain an understanding of the environmental impact of different industries and contribute to making informed decisions in sustainable development.

## Data Souce:

Our dataset is compiled from publicly available data from nature.com and encompasses the product carbon footprints (PCF) for various companies. PCFs represent the greenhouse gas emissions associated with specific products, quantified in CO2 (carbon dioxide equivalent).

## Data Structure
The dataset consists of 4 tables containing information regarding carbon emissions generated during the production of goods.
